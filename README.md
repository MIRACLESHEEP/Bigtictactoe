# Bigtictactoe

## Description  
###### This is a game coded for my grade ten sommative. 
###### The language this was coded in is C++.  
###### It was coded on my computer and uploaded to github as an afterthought.    
###### The game is called **Bigtictactoe**, which is a very large scale version of tictactoe, with nine grids in one larger grid.
###### It is slightly different than the original game, in that the player must simply have 5/9 grids captured to win.
